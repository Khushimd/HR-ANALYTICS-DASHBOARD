### ⚙️ DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Employees = COUNT(Employee_Data[EmployeeID])
Active Employees = CALCULATE(COUNT(Employee_Data[EmployeeID]), Employee_Data[Attrition] = "No")
Attrition Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(Employee_Data[EmployeeID]), Employee_Data[Attrition] = "Yes")
Attrition Rate (%) = DIVIDE([Attrition Count], [Total Employees]) * 100
Average Salary = AVERAGE(Employee_Data[MonthlyIncome])
Average Experience = AVERAGE(Employee_Data[TotalWorkingYears])



Attrition by Department =
CALCULATE(COUNT(Employee_Data[EmployeeID]), Employee_Data[Attrition] = "Yes", VALUES(Employee_Data[Depa
